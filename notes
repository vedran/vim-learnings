- Let's take a step back and think about the tools we have to edit text
- Mouse and Keyboard
- Mouse -> Pretty good at selecting things but not great at fast precision

- Keyboard -> Great at precision but most of the keys are already used for inserting content. Only a few keys for navigation, and some modifiers on those keys to move around a little bit easier

Some examples where navigation and editing usually involves a lot of mouse work and many arrow key presses.

1) Navigating to and editing very specific parts of text

```
<div><span class="change-me">I love html</span></div>
```

a) Changing the class name
b) Changing content inside of the span
b) Replacing all content inside of the div


2) Repeating the same set of actions (simple)

```
properties = {
    "first_name": first_name,
    "last_name": last_name,
    "email": email,
}
```

To

```
properties = {}

if (my_condition) {
    properties["first_name"] = first_name
    properties["last_name"] = last_name
    properties["email"] = email
}
```

3) Repeating more complicated actions

```
Mia
Lucija
Ema
Ana
Nika
Ivan
Matej
Marko
Filip
Matea
```

to

```
1. Mia
2. Lucija
3. Ema
4. Ana
5. Nika
6. Ivan
7. Matej
8. Marko
9. Filip
10. Matea
```

4) Column editing


```
event_name = event.get('event_name', None)
event_date = event.get('event_date', None)
event_time = event.get('event_time', None)
event_author = event.get('event_author', None)
event_source = event.get('event_source', None)
event_location = event.get('event_location', None)
```

to

```
name = event.get('event_name', None)
date = event.get('event_date', None)
time = event.get('event_time', None)
author = event.get('event_author', None)
source = event.get('event_source', None)
location = event.get('event_location', None)
```


5) Finding and replacing within a scope

```
if (has_date) {
    new_date = '2018'
    old_date = '2017'
    birth_date = '2019';
}
```

to

```
if (has_date) {
    new_day = '2018'
    old_day = '2017'
    birth_day = '2019';
}
```
